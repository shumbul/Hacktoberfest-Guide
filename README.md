# What is Hacktoberfest? 🤔
</br>

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source projects, their maintainers, and the entire community of contributors. Each October, open source maintainers give new contributors extra attention as they guide developers through their first pull requests on GitHub.

You can read the official details and rules at the Hacktoberfest website. Check out the official website here! [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)
